      <description>So a while ago after being absolutely destroyed by a friend in a game of chess, I decided to actually learn the game.
What&amp;rsquo;s chess? Chess is a popular game of strategy where two players play against each other. It involves a chess board containing 64 squares and 16 pieces on each side.
The players have a pair of rooks, bishops and knights. They also have eight pawns, a queen and a king.</description>
