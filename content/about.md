I am a Linux and computer enthusiast from Kerala, India. I do programming as a hobby :) **I use [arch](https://archlinux.org) btw.**
You can find my (x11) dotfiles [here](https://github.com/rv178/.dotfiles).
I like writing open source software and most of them are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/rv178).

I also do frontend web development. I'm currently learning Rust and working on a variety of projects,
including a Discord bot called [BookBot](https://github.com/rv178/bookbot).
