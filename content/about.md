A Linux and computer enthusiast! I do programming as a hobby. I use [arch](https://archlinux.org) btw.
You can find my (x11) dotfiles [here](https://github.com/rv178/.dotfiles).
I like writing open source software and most of them are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/rv178).

I also do frontend web development. I'm currently learning Rust and working on a variety of projects,
including a Discord bot called [BookBot](https://github.com/rv178/bookbot).

I write bad code mainly in:

-   [C](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
-   [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
-   [Python](https://python.org)
-   [JS/TS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [Shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script)
