So hi! I have been using Linux for almost 5 months now and I have learned a lot! Just wanted to share my experience with everyone.

When I asked my friend (who is an expert in Linux), he recommended me Pop!\_OS, an Ubuntu based distro. So, I installed it and it was my first Linux distribution. My experience using Pop!\_OS was amazing and it still is one of my favourite distributions.

While Linux seemed harder due to the frequent interaction with the command line, I had a bit of experience using it before (when using WSL). So the initial switch wasn't that hard for me. I was still dual booting Windows with Pop!\_OS during this time, and was still a Linux amateur.

Things started to change when I came to know of Arch Linux, a lightweight distribution. I started reading the Arch wiki, and soon installed it on bare metal (after a bit of bullying _ahem_), triple booting Windows, Pop!\_OS and Arch.

And I ABSOLUTELY loved it. I deleted my Pop!\_OS partition a while later, and Arch became my primary OS. It was a great way to learn more about Linux and its components. The first desktop environment I used with Arch, was KDE Plasma.

While I certainly liked the desktop environment, I soon switched to a tiling window manager called i3. After using i3 for a few hours, I realised it wasn't the best option for me, and switched back to KDE Plasma. A few days later I installed BSPWM, and I liked it a lot. Inspired from a friend, I installed some of his configs and modified them according to my needs.

Using a tiling window manager at first was a bit difficult. But soon, I started relying more on my keyboard than my mouse, switching out code editors like VS code for (Neo)Vim and relying on keyboard shortcuts for my system. Around this time, I had an idea of setting up my dotfiles repo, and I made one. Initially it was just my friend's dotfiles, but modified according to my needs, but soon I started writing my own configs and then published the repo.

My BSPWM config now:

Soon, I switched to DWM and I have been using it ever since. It's my favourite tiling window manager. The level of extensibility it provides is just amazing! Sometimes patching DWM (as well as other suckless utilities) can be a bit tedious though.
