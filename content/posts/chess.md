Chess is good

### why?

because I say so

**you have 16 pieces in chess which u move**

```diff
very good piece = queen

good piece = rooks

medium piece = bishop and knight

weak piece = pawn
```

### queen

queen is very good piece because it can move all direction

### rook

rook is good piece because it can move straight

### bishop and knight

bishop and knight medium piece because bishop only move diagonally and knight move two times straight and one time diagonally

### pawn

pawn is weak piece because it can only move forward but it can capture diagonally

### king

don't kill ur king else u lose i think

### castling

castling is very poggers and you move ur king one space and your rook jumps over your king (but in real life not possible since elephant cannot jump)

### en passant

this is another very poggers move where your pawn on the 5th rank captures pawn on 5th rank

congrats u just read a 1 minute shitpost
