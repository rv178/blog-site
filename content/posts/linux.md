So hi! I have been using Linux for almost 5 months now and I have learned a lot! Just wanted to share my experience with everyone.

When I asked my friend (who is an expert in Linux), he recommended me Pop!\_OS, an Ubuntu based distro. So, I installed it and it was my first Linux distribution. My experience using Pop!\_OS was amazing and it still is one of my favourite distributions.

While Linux seemed harder due to the frequent interaction with the command line, I had a bit of experience using it before (when using WSL). So the initial switch wasn't that hard for me. I was still dual booting Windows with Pop!\_OS during this time, and was still a Linux amateur.

```js
console.log("shit");
```
