      <description>Chess is good
why? because I say so
you have 16 pieces in chess which u move
very good piece = queen good piece = rooks medium piece = bishop and knight weak piece = pawn queen queen is very good piece because it can move all direction
rook rook is good piece because it can move straight
bishop and knight bishop and knight medium piece because bishop only move diagonally and knight move two times straight and one time diagonally</description>

      <description>So hi! I have been using Linux for almost 5 months now and I have learned a lot! Just wanted to share my experience with everyone.
When I asked my friend (who is an expert in Linux), he recommended me Pop!_OS, an Ubuntu based distro. So, I installed it and it was my first Linux distribution. My experience using Pop!_OS was amazing and it still is one of my favourite distributions.</description>
