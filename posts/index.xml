      <description>So a while ago after being absolutely destroyed by a friend in a game of chess, I decided to actually learn the game.
What&amp;rsquo;s chess? Chess is a popular game of strategy where two players play against each other. It involves a chess board containing 64 squares and 16 pieces on each side.
The players have a pair of rooks, bishops and knights. They also have eight pawns, a queen and a king.</description>

      <description>So hi! I have been using Linux for almost 5 months now and I have learned a lot! Just wanted to share my experience with everyone.
When I asked my friend (who is an expert in Linux), he recommended me Pop!_OS, an Ubuntu based distro. So, I installed it and it was my first Linux distribution. My experience using Pop!_OS was amazing and it still is one of my favourite distributions.</description>
