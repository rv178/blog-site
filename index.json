[{"content":" So hi! I have been using Linux for almost 5 months now and I have learned a lot! Just wanted to share my experience with everyone.\nWhen I asked my friend (who is an expert in Linux), he recommended me Pop!_OS, an Ubuntu based distro. So, I installed it and it was my first Linux distribution. My experience using Pop!_OS was amazing and it still is one of my favourite distributions.\nWhile Linux seemed harder due to the frequent interaction with the command line, I had a bit of experience using it before (when using WSL). So the initial switch wasn\u0026rsquo;t that hard for me. I was still dual booting Windows with Pop!_OS during this time, and was still a Linux amateur.\nThings started to change when I came to know of Arch Linux, a lightweight distribution. I started reading the Arch wiki, and soon installed it on bare metal (after a bit of bullying ahem), triple booting Windows, Pop!_OS and Arch.\nAnd I ABSOLUTELY loved it. I deleted my Pop!_OS partition a while later, and Arch became my primary OS. It was a great way to learn more about Linux and its components. The first desktop environment I used with Arch, was KDE Plasma.\nWhile I certainly liked the desktop environment, I soon switched to a tiling window manager called i3. After using i3 for a few hours, I realised it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best option for me, and switched back to KDE Plasma. A few days later I installed BSPWM, and I liked it a lot. Inspired from a friend, I installed some of his configs and modified them according to my needs.\nUsing a tiling window manager at first was a bit difficult. But soon, I started relying more on my keyboard than my mouse, switching out code editors like VS code for (Neo)Vim and relying on keyboard shortcuts for my system. Around this time, I had an idea of setting up my dotfiles repo, and I made one. Initially it was just my friend\u0026rsquo;s dotfiles, but modified according to my needs, but soon I started writing my own configs and then published the repo.\nMy BSPWM config now:\nSoon, I switched to DWM and I have been using it ever since. It\u0026rsquo;s my favourite tiling window manager. The level of extensibility it provides is just amazing! Sometimes patching DWM (as well as other suckless utilities) can be a bit tedious though.\n","permalink":"https://rv178.is-a.dev/posts/my-linux-journey/","summary":"So hi!
