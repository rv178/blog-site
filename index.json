[{"content":" So a while ago after being absolutely destroyed by a friend in a game of chess, I decided to actually learn the game.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s chess? Chess is a popular game of strategy where two players play against each other. It involves a chess board containing 64 squares and 16 pieces on each side.\nThe players have a pair of rooks, bishops and knights. They also have eight pawns, a queen and a king. The game is over when you deliver a check (threatening to capture the king of the opposite side) which the enemy king cannot escape.\nGetting better I started by playing games (yeah too obvious) and registering on lichess.org, an amazing open source chess website. Most of these games were against my friends because after playing a rated game I lost horribly to an opponent (got checkmated in like 9 moves).\nAfter playing a few games I decided to check out lichess.org/learn which proved to be a great learning experience.\nChess engines I didn\u0026rsquo;t become a grandmaster after finishing it (unfortunately) so I played more games, particularly against the Stockfish chess engine because my friends wouldn\u0026rsquo;t agree to play with me.\nAround this time I was extremely interested in making a chess engine (inspired by stockfish) and I created a project in Rust, but eventually gave up because it was a lot of work. I had managed to create a board implementation but after trying to implement FEN string parsing I gave up midway.\nHowever for the fellow devs who are reading this, chessprogramming.org covers a lot of information regarding engine development in detail.\nStatus Currently I can beat Stockfish Level 4 (1700) on lichess.org and I managed to draw a match with Level 5 (2000).\nI still suck at chess but I hope to become better in the future. It\u0026rsquo;s a very beautiful game and I enjoy playing every match.\n","permalink":"https://rv178.is-a.dev/posts/learning-chess/","summary":"So a while ago after being absolutely destroyed by a friend in a game of chess, I decided to actually learn the game.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s chess?

Just wanted to share my experience with everyone.\nWhen I asked my friend (who is an expert in Linux), he recommended me Pop!_OS, an Ubuntu based distro. So, I installed it and it was my first Linux distribution. My experience using Pop!_OS was amazing and it still is one of my favourite distributions.\nWhile Linux seemed harder due to the frequent interaction with the command line, I had a bit of experience using it before (when using WSL). So the initial switch wasn\u0026rsquo;t that hard for me. I was still dual booting Windows with Pop!_OS during this time, and was still a Linux amateur.\nThings started to change when I came to know of Arch Linux, a lightweight distribution. I started reading the Arch wiki, and soon installed it on bare metal (after a bit of bullying ahem), triple booting Windows, Pop!_OS and Arch.\nAnd I ABSOLUTELY loved it. I deleted my Pop!_OS partition a while later, and Arch became my primary OS. It was a great way to learn more about Linux and its components. The first desktop environment I used with Arch, was KDE Plasma.\nWhile I certainly liked the desktop environment, I soon switched to a tiling window manager called i3. After using i3 for a few hours, I realised it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best option for me, and switched back to KDE Plasma. A few days later I installed BSPWM, and I liked it a lot. Inspired from a friend, I installed some of his configs and modified them according to my needs.\nUsing a tiling window manager at first was a bit difficult. But soon, I started relying more on my keyboard than my mouse, switching out code editors like VS code for (Neo)Vim and relying on keyboard shortcuts for my system. Around this time, I had an idea of setting up my dotfiles repo, and I made one. Initially it was just my friend\u0026rsquo;s dotfiles, but modified according to my needs, but soon I started writing my own configs and then published the repo.\nMy BSPWM config now:\nSoon, I switched to DWM and I have been using it ever since. It\u0026rsquo;s my favourite tiling window manager. The level of extensibility it provides is just amazing! Sometimes patching DWM (as well as other suckless utilities) can be a bit tedious though.\n","permalink":"https://rv178.is-a.dev/posts/my-linux-journey/","summary":"So hi!
